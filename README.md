[cards with friends](https://cards-with-friends.fly.dev/) is a multi-player realtime card game area built during [nwHacks 2022](https://www.nwhacks.io/).

Do you like cards? Do you have friends or want to make some? This is the game for you!

Modelled off games such as [Gartic Phone](https://garticphone.com/) or [skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io/), we wanted a way for people to be able to enjoy their favourite card games with their friends in just a couple clicks. Make a game, send the codes to your friends, and start playing.

Cards with Friends lets you customize how you want to play by letting you:

- Adding decks and discard piles
- Add a fanned tableau (think the shared cards in texas hold-em)
- Auto deal your hands
- Drag and drop the cards you want to play

Try out a couple games with your friends, its easy to play Go-Fish, Texas-Holdem, Crazy-eights, or any of your favourite games! Stealing cards from your opponents hand is a **feature** as well, not a bug.
